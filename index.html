                            <p>Throughout the software engineering program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have learned a lot about computer science. I have learned how to communicate about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), how to work in a team environment, how data structures and algorithms work, and how to create secure code.</p>
							<p>For starters, I enrolled in a course titled Collaboration and Team Project. This course instructed me how to use Git to submit new branches on an existing file. Every student in our course was tasked with inserting our own favorite artists and songs into a “jukebox” java application. At the end of the course, we had one file that included all of our favorite songs and artists. </p>
							<p>Another important course that I was enrolled in would be Software Development Lifecycle. Obviously, this course dealt with learning about the SDLC. I also learned a lot about working with the Agile method and utilizing scrum methods for sprint planning. </p>
							<p>When it comes to data structures and algorithms, the course that helped me the most was my Data Structures and Algorithms course. In this course, we learned about various algorithms and what kind of data structures they can be used in. Our final project also involved incorporating one of the most useful data structure and algorithm combinations: the binary search tree. </p>
							<p>As I progressed along my program, I enrolled in a Structured Database course. This course was extremely useful in teaching me how databases work and how they can be used. I also learned how to use SQL queries to create a database and a few tables. SQL became a language that I picked up on very easily, and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. </p>
							<p>Lastly, in the term before my final term, I enrolled in a Secure Coding course. This course taught me the fundamentals of various security measures in code. We learned about buffer overflows, SQL injections, exceptions, encryption, and how to write a sound security policy. We also learned about the different levels of severity for security issues as well as the likelihood for them to occur. </p>
							<p>Despite my lack of professional experience, I feel confident that I can adapt to any work environment that I may employed into. SNHU has taught me many valuable skills that can be utilized in a professional environment. </p>
							<p>In my ePortfolio, I have included three artifacts: One that displays my knowledge on software design and engineering, one that displays my knowledge on data structures and algorithms, and one that displays my ability to work with a database. All three of these artifacts have been re-worked and enhanced to better showcase my abilities as a software developer.</p>

						<!-- Project 1-->
						<article id="project1">
							<center><h2 class="major">Project 1 - Invest Company</h2></center>
							<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<center><p>Investment Company Link: </p></center>
							<center><a href="https://github.com/ZacGonzalez/ZacGonzalez.github.io/blob/main/InvestmentCompany.cpp" target="_blank">Investment Company</a></center>
							<p>  </p>
							<p>This artifact is my final project for the Software Reverse Engineering course. This project is a simple C++ application that has a user login to an investment company application. The user then has the ability to view the clients of the investment company and change their investment plan (either retirement or brokerage). This project was originally created in February of 2022.</p>
							<p>I included this artifact to showcase my abilities to create a basic C++ application. This application utilizes user input such as a login and also asks the user if they want to view the clients or change their selection. As I’ve mentioned, this application showcases my ability to create a basic C++ application. When I started with this artifact, it had errors that prevented it from running. So, I started by fixing those errors. I also re-structured the application to make it more efficient and readable.</p>
							<p>I believe I did meet the course objectives for this enhancement. I planned on fixing the errors to make it run properly along with re-structuring the application to make it more readable. I could have potentially added more to the application such as the inclusion of an admin menu which would allow a user to create or delete employees. However, my goal in utilizing this artifact is to simply showcase my programming abilities, so I believe that I have reached my objective for this artifact.</p>
							<p>There is a lot that I have learned about C++ programming throughout my program. However, I have not retained a lot of that information. Thankfully, while working with this artifact, I was able to look over applications I have worked on in the past to help with my enhancement. I implemented a switch case in this artifact which is something I did not have in the original. This inclusion made the code much more efficient and I plan to utilize switch cases in the future. The only challenges I faced was figuring out how to correct the errors that I came across. I had to look a few issues up (especially using stackoverflow). But, thankfully, I was able to correct the issues and the result is a fully-functioning C++ application.</p>

						<!-- Project 2-->
						<article id="project2">
							<center><h2 class="major">Project 2 - Binary Search Tree</h2></center>
							<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<center><p>Binary Search Tree Link: </p></center>
							<center><a href="https://github.com/ZacGonzalez/ZacGonzalez.github.io/blob/main/BinarySearchTree.cpp" target="_blank">Binary Search Tree</a></center>
							<p>  </p>
							<p>This artifact is my final project from my Data Structures and Algorithms course. This project utilizes a binary search tree, one of the most efficient data structures and algorithms, to load, search, and delete bids from a CSV file. This project was originally created in April of 2021.</p>
							<p>This artifact, as mentioned above, utilizes a binary search tree. A binary search tree takes a list of elements and sets a “half-point”. When a user searches for something, the algorithm will compare what they’re searching to the half-point. If it is larger, the algorithm will ignore the smaller half, then set a new half point between the original and the maximum (the opposite if it’s smaller). This is continued until either the item is found or if it does not exist. This is much more efficient than having the algorithm search through every single item one after another. This is why binary search trees are so efficient, and why I think this artifact is a great representation of my knowledge on data structures and algorithms.</p>
							<p>I believe that I met the course objectives I planned to meet in this enhancement. I have great structure in my code, and I successfully showcase the layout of a binary search tree. </p>
							<p>I, in the same case as milestone two, learned a lot while working on this project. I, obviously, have taken the Data Structures and Algorithms course in the past, however it has been over a year ago. So, it was nice to go and re-hash on some old projects to make it fresh in my memory. Honestly, I did not know entirely what I was doing when I worked on the artifact the first time, however, now, I can look back at the code and really understand what it means and how it works.</p>

							<center><h2 class="major">Project 3 - Java and MySQL</h2></center>
							<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<center><a href="https://github.com/ZacGonzalez/ZacGonzalez.github.io/blob/main/sales_2016sales.sql" target="_blank">MySQL Sales Database</a></center>
							<p> </p>
							<center><a href="https://github.com/ZacGonzalez/ZacGonzalez.github.io/blob/main/MySQLAccess.java" target="_blank">Java Project</a></center>
							<p>  </p>
							<p>
							<p>This artifact is a database that I created in June of 2022. I had worked on a database application in the past, but did not have the source code, so I decided to create a new one. This database imported information from a CSV file I had used in another project. I then created a Java application that links to this database and displays information from the database.</p>
							<p>This artifact’s inclusion is justifiable. I was asked to enhance a database I have worked on in the past. As mentioned above, I had to create a new database and start from nothing. I successfully utilized MySQL queries to create the database along with importing a CSV file. I also successfully created a Java application that linked to the database. The original database I had worked with was only a simple database with a few items populating the table in it. However, this database I created has a lot of entries that are more complex than the previous database.</p>
							<p>I will be honest: I am actually surprised I was able to reach the original goal I set. I had to do a lot of research along with studying code I found online, but I was able to create a Java application that links to the database.I have never done this before, so I am proud that I got the application to work correctly.</p>
							<p>As mentioned above, I have never built an application that links to a database. So, this was a very new project for me. I will admit, there is a lot of room for improvement. But, I am glad it works! I did not have any significant issues with MySQL to be honest. Perhaps a career in that field would not be a bad choice as SQL comes fairly easy to me. However, I struggled quite a bit when creating the Java application. For starters, I have been using C++ for the past few terms, so I have not done anything in Java since last year. I also needed to do some research to figure out how I could link my application to my MySQL database. After a lot of trial and error (along with downloading the JDBC linker) I was able to get this program to run.</p>
